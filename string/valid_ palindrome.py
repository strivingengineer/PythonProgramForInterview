Leetcode 125. Valid Palindrome
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/
A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters 
and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. 
Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.
Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

Example 2:
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

Approach: We can use the two pointer approach to check if the string is Palindrome or not only thing we need to focus
is that we are only checking the Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers if current character is not among
them then we increase or decrease the pomiters.
Time/Space Complexity: O(n)/O(1)
